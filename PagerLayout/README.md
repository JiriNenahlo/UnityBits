# PagerLayout
Responsive GridLayoutGroup that sets correct column & row count based on minimum item cell size
and attempts to stretch items across the full width/height if no more columns would fit.

Works like a pager, with associated buttons that show other parts of the dataset based on the selected page.
Items are dynamically sent to this layout and can be swapped during runtime easily.
